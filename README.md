MyUtils
===================

These are several general utilities I have written because they are useful to
me. Both projects are released under the

tpg.py
-------------------

This is a script for accessing timetable information for Transport Publics
Genevois. It provides a minimal commandline interface or can be imported as a
library.

hsbc.py
-------------------

A vague attempt at a tool for parsing HSBC statement pages and translating them
into JSON. From there can be used as you wish. Not to be relied upon but can
give useful output.
